# Hello-World
The Hello World project is a time-honored tradition in computer programming.
My name is Maggie and I'm from Bulgaria. Currently I study MSc Project Management in the University of Sussex.
This is a great, challenging and fun opportunity.
I always wanted to learn how to code and I'll do my best to take out the most of the CF:G course!!!
